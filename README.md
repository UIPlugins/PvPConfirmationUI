# PvPUI
Ensure that you really want to pvp!

# Why use this?

Pvp is a dangerous thing! By ensuring that you really want to attack a player you can ensure that you're not accidently hurting someone! This also helps to curb auto clicking and features button randomization to make sure you're actually paying attention to what you press!
